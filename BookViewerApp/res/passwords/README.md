# passwords.gz
`passwords.gz` is password list from [Owner avatar
10K-Most-Popular-Passwords
](https://github.com/iryndin/10K-Most-Popular-Passwords/) by [iryndin](https://github.com/iryndin/). Yes, it's old, 5 years ago, but that's fine.

## What's changed.
It's gziped as you can see to save some space. That's it. We didn't save much because there were not many overlap.

# words.gz
`words.gz` is from [List Of English Words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) by [dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl). It's much larger. Duplicate items have been removed.

# additional_passwords.txt
Lists above are not designed for PDF. I just added some which I came up with. It's not gziped because it's very small and plain text is easier to change.
