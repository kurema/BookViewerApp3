# The OPDS Catalog spec extends Atom (RFC4287), and the additions require some
# patterns not used in the Atom schema. The first is atomUriExceptOPDS, which
# is used to describe an atomLink whose rel value is an atomNCName (no-colon
# name) or any URI other than these from OPDS Catalogs. In these cases, no
# opds:price element should appear.

# To simplify OPDS Catalog validation, we do not use Schematron to assert that
# any atom:link with a rel value of ".../acquisition/buy" must be accompanied
# by one or more opds:price elements.
# Instead we rely on Relax NG to describe one of three situations:
# - the rel value is ".../acquisition/buy" and at least one opds:price element
#   is required
# - the rel value is ".../acquisition/borrow" or ".../acquisition/subscribe" or
#   ".../acquisition/sample", in case opds:price elements may be
#   included; or
# - the value of the rel attribute is any other URI or an Atom-defined no-colon
#   name, and no opds:price element is permitted
 
# Note that this OPDS Catalog schema includes atom.rnc, so that schema must be
# present for validation.
# 
# Note also that atom.rnc defines atomUri as text and not as xsd:anyURI, and so
# wherever the Atom spec requires an IRI, the schema will not check the value
# against any URI pattern or logic. The OPDS Catalog schema overrides atom.rnc
# to provide a relatively accurate test. With the approval of XSD 1.1, the
# schema definition should change to xsd:anyURI to match what the spec text
# says.
