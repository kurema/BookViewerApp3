## Why 3?
It's because there is [1](https://github.com/kurema/BookViewerApp/), which I developed five years before this.
I've been wanting to upgrade, and I tried to rewrite all. That's [2](https://github.com/kurema/BookViewerApp2/).
But it just failed.
This 3 is based on 1. Though its appearance is totally different, making use of old codes helped me a lot.

So that's why this is 3, not 1, not 2.
